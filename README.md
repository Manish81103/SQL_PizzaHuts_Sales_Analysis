## Data Sources
The project uses the following tables:

 1.Orders: Contains information about customer orders, including order ID, order date, and order time.

2.OrderDetails: Provides detailed information for each order, order details id, including order ID, pizza ID and quantity.

3.PizzaTypes: Lists the types of pizzas offered, including pizza type ID, pizza type name, category
and ingredients.

4.Pizzas: Details specific pizzas, including pizza ID, name, pizza type id , pizza size and price.
## SQL Techniques Used
## 1. Joins:
i. Inner Join: To combine related data from multiple tables where there is a match in both tables.

ii. Left Join: To include all records from the left table and matched records from the right table.

iii. Right Join: To include all records from the right table and matched records from the left table.

## 2. Group By:
i. Used to aggregate data, such as calculating total sales by pizza type or monthly sales trends.

ii. Applied with aggregate functions like SUM(), COUNT(), and AVG() to extract meaningful metrics.

## 3. SQL Queries:
i. Sales Analysis by Pizza Type: Analyzing which pizza types are the most popular and generate the highest revenue.

ii. Monthly Sales Trends: Identifying sales trends over different periods.

iii. Order Value Analysis: Calculating average order value and identifying high-value orders.

iv. Customer Behavior Analysis: Determining customer ordering patterns, including frequency and order size.
## Key Insights
1. Pizza Type Popularity: Identified the most popular pizza types and those generating the highest revenue, providing insights into customer preferences.

2. Sales Trends: Analyzed sales data to identify peak sales periods, which can inform marketing strategies.

3. Order Value: Determined the average order value and identified high-value customers, helping tailor promotions.

4. Product Performance: Revealed top-performing pizzas and types, assisting with menu optimization.
## Conclusion:
The Pizza Hut Sales Analysis project successfully demonstrates how SQL can be leveraged to analyze sales data and generate valuable business insights. By using joins, grouping, and various SQL queries, the project uncovers trends and patterns that can guide decision-making.
